 https://doi.org/10.1007/s13202-018-0498-4

An exploratory analysis of the Agbabu field volumetric parameters data has been conducted, 
with the objective of acquiring intimate understanding of the data prior to spatial modeling. 
This work conducted detailed analyses on various univariate descriptive statistics and probability 
distribution of the volumetric parameters. All the computations and statistical analyses herein 
outlined were done using version 3.3.3 of R.
